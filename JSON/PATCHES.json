3: preset b/bank 1
4: preset c/bank 1
5: preset a/bank 2
6: preset b/bank 2

cc12: 0-63 fx on, 64-128 fx off
cc13: tap tempo

5: preset d/bank 1
6: preset a/bank 2
7: preset b/bank 2

Look into short circuit and over voltage protection when deploying project (not sure if necessary with the official PSU but couldn't hurt)
